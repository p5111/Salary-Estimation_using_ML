The research intends to show the potential of reinforcement learning approaches to en-
hance the efficiency and safety of surface goods transportation. The Vehicle may modify ts speed to maintain a proper separation by accurately assessing the speed of a lead-
ing heavy-duty vehicle. As a result, fuel efficiency is improved, and CO2 emissions are decreased. Traditional methods usually rely on communication between vehicles to deter-
mine the speed profile of the leading vehicle. Not all vehicles are equipped with this kind of communication capability.

Heavy-duty trucks make up a significant share of the demand for surface goods trans-
portation, which makes an emphasis on fuel efficiency and environmental sustainability
necessary. Also using reinforcement learning to predict the velocity of the leading
vehicle is a potential solution to the issue of determining speed without inter-vehicle
communication.
Using past speed measurements and an understanding of the gradient of the road,
the method aims to produce precise estimates of the leading vehicleâ€™s velocity. This in
turn aids in driving technique optimisation, enhancing both the efficiency and safety of
all surface freight transit. Heavy-duty vehicle velocity prediction could be revolutionized
by RL, opening the door to autonomous and intelligent transportation in the future.
